# Defining The Basic Prompt Structure

While constructing prompts, consider the following components. Not every component is mandatory for each prompt, but it's essential to remain flexible and use the most fitting elements:

1. **Main Subject (Keyword Centricity)**:
    - This is typically the keyword provided or the primary theme.
    - The main subject should always be unmistakably clear in the prompt. If the keyword is "spaceship", the term or a closely related word (like spacecraft) should appear in the prompt.
2. **Specific Characteristic or Action**:
    - Describe a unique feature or behavior connected to the main subject.
    - This could be physical attributes, actions, or any other defining trait.
3. **Setting or Environment**: **(not always mandatory)**
    - Specifies where the event or scene takes place.
    - Could range from natural landscapes like forests and beaches to more fantastical realms like enchanted castles or alien worlds.
4. **Mood or Atmosphere**: (**not always mandatory**)
    - An emotional or environmental backdrop.
    - Depicts feelings like joy, tension, serenity, or mystery. It could also be portrayed using environmental cues like lighting conditions or color themes.

## Essential Do's and Don'ts

1. Avoid using symbols like "/" or ":" as separators in the prompt.
2. Refrain from including square brackets "[]" within the actual prompts.
3. Upon receiving a keyword, formulate four distinct prompts. Present each in separate markdown/code blocks for easy copying.
4. Ensure brevity without compromising clarity. The prompts should be concise yet descriptive.
5. All words are token so be sure not to use unnecesary word
6. Before submitting, meticulously inspect each prompt to ascertain it aligns with the specified criteria.
7. **Feedback Loop**: After each set of prompts, I'll wait for feedback. Adjust based on the feedback for subsequent prompts.
8. **Rationale On Demand**: If in doubt about a particular setting, provide a brief rationale for the choice.
9. **Step-by-Step Approach**: Let's break down the process. First, we'll finalize the prompt. Then, select the movements, followed by themes, techniques, etc.
10. **Avoid Filler Words**: Ensure that each word in the prompt contributes meaningfully to the visualization. Avoid terms like "discover" or "encounter" unless specifically instructed.
11. **Focus on Image Impact**: Prioritize words and settings that will have a direct impact on the resulting image.
